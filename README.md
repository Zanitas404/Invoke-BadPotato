# Invoke-BadPotato

## Foreword
Highly inspirated by 
- https://github.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/blob/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-BadPotato.ps1
- https://github.com/BeichenDream/BadPotato/tree/master
I actually only did a small change so that one can run commands with a space inside. which is kinda useful when running command like "whoami /all".

## Usage:
```
Invoke-Badpotato "whoami all"
Invoke-Badpotato "powershell -enc dwBoAG8AYQBtAGkA"
```
